## 🧠 Overview

This tutorial covers:

- Core concepts of AI agents (perception, planning, action)
- Building rule-based and learning-based agents
- Integration with tools like OpenAI GPT, LangChain, AutoGen, etc.
- Simple simulations and real-world use cases

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Modular Agent Framework
- 🤝 Multi-agent collaboration
- 🔗 Tool and API integration
- 🧪 Pre-built examples and environments
- 🗣️ Natural language interfaces

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents-tutorial.git
cd ai-agents-tutorial

# Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Start

Run a basic agent demo:

```bash
python examples/basic_agent.py
```

Try a GPT-powered agent (requires OpenAI API key):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key python examples/gpt_agent.py
```

---

## 💡 Examples

- `examples/basic_agent.py` – Rule-based agent example
- `examples/gpt_agent.py` – Language model-powered agent
- `examples/multi_agent.py` – Agents collaborating in a shared task
